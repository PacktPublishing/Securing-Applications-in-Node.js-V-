## About the Video Course
Everyone agrees that web application security is very important but there are very few to take it seriously. There have been lots of high-profile instances of websites having their password databases exposed to the World (e.g. Ashley Madison and Adobe). You don’t want the application you are building to be the next big security horror story. This course will get you up-to-speed on the key attack vectors, quickly covering issues such as cross-site scripting, CSRF, and SQL injection. It will provide you with clear, practical approaches to mitigating these problems. It will show you how to implement OAuth and two-factor authentication for the additional protection of users who need it. Further, we will delve into the critical process of adding secured, well-thought-out authentication and authorization to a Node.js application. After completing this course, you should be confident in your ability to make an application secure with Node.js and keep your data protected.
